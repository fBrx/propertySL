{"name":"propertySL @ fBrx","tagline":"editing properties like a pro","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a domain specific language for editing java property files and multi-language resource bundles. The project started initially as a sample project for exploring domain specific languages and the [Eclipse Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) technology.\r\n\r\n# PropertySL\r\n\r\nThe defined domain specific language - named _PropertySL_ - let's you define properties and resource bundles in a concise way. It has support for namespaces, nesting and internationalization. The syntax is pretty straight forward to read and lets you define everything you need in one file.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.github.fbrx.propertysl.demo{\r\n\t\r\n\tSUPPORTED_LOCALES = {\r\n\t\tde, default en, es \r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpackage subpackage {\r\n\t\tsimpleProp = \"Howdy, partner!\"\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tcomplexProp = {\r\n\t\tde : \"Hallo, Welt!\"\r\n\t\ten : \"Hello, world!\"\r\n\t\tes : \"Hola, mundo!\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Editor support\r\n\r\nThe PropertySL was defined by means of the [Eclipse Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) and [Eclipse Xtend](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtend/) technologies. Thus there is also first class (Eclipse based) editor support built-in.\r\n![PropertySL Editor](https://raw.github.com/fBrx/propertySL/master/editor.png)\r\n\r\n# Attributions\r\n\r\n* Icons for the Eclipse Outline were taken from the [IKONS](http://ikons.piotrkwiatkowski.co.uk/ \"IKONS\") package by [Piotr Kwiatkowski](http://www.piotrkwiatkowski.co.uk/ )","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
