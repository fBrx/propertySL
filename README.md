# overview

This repository contains a domain specific language for editing java property files and multi-language resource bundles

# background

this project started as sample project for exploring domain specific languages and the xtext/xtend technologies

# PropertySL - the DSL

The defined DSL - PropertySL - let's you define properties and resoure bundles in a concise way. It has support for namespaces, nesting and internationalization. The syntax is pretty straight forward to read and lets you define everything that belongs together in one file. Alternatively you can split up your configuration in different files.

# Editor support

The PropertySL was defined by means of the xtext technologiy. Thus there is also first class (Eclipse based) editor support built-in.

# Licences

Ions for the Eclipse Outline were taken from the [IKONS](http://ikons.piotrkwiatkowski.co.uk/ "IKONS") package
